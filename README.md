# Linguicism and standard language ideology on Twitter/X

This repository contains code and data for my bachelor's thesis titled _Lingwicyzm w polskich tweetach na serwisie X i pr√≥ba jego automatycznego rozpoznawania_ (_Linguicism in Polish tweets on X and its automatic detection_).

The project is a proof of concept for an annotion schema for labeling linguicism and other standard language ideology related phenomena in Polish tweets and a labeled dataset that could be used for machine learning purposes. It also includes a demonstration of a classification task utilizing the dataset.

[Test set](Test%20set) contains data used for testing the first annotation schema - an unalabeld dataset, a labeled dataset and a diagram of the annotation schema with labels.

[Actual set](Actual%20set) contains data labeled with the new, reworked annotation schema - an unlabeled dataset, a labeled dataset and a diagram of the annotation schema with labels.
